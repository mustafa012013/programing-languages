   <h2> programming languages are : </h2>
    <p>Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.
	<br> Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer.
	<br> The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.”
	<br> Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.”
	<br> Each language, from c Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.
	<br>

These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. </p>
